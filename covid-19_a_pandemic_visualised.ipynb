In a country with 264 million people and with varying standards of health care, this was a relief.\n",

    "It was initially hoped that Africa might be able to avoid cases as global transport links shut down. However, looking at the current figures, there are now cases in most countries across the African continent and according to the latest WHO situation report, there is [community transmission in 22 African countries](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200330-sitrep-70-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=7e0fe3f8_2). With a continent population of 1.2 billion this is extremely worrying. With every major country on the planet now facing its own coronavirus crisis, Sub-Saharan African nations will likely be left to fend for themselves."

    "Hindsight is a powerful thing and it is particularly sobering to look back at the way the media reported the early days of the outbreak in China. As the cases grew almost exclusively in China for about a month, it was easy for us in the West to distance ourselves from a very real threat of an epidemic that would reach us some day - the numbers we saw were worrying but were still 'just in China'. The idea that Western nations could experience the same life-changing restrictions of quarantines and lock-downs or our societies to be crippled in such a devastating way seemed somewhat farsical. The media tells a rather different story today.\n",

    "We are not near the end of this crisis but my hope is that a silver lining of this all will be to show people around the globe that events can change even the lives of the most privileged. Perhaps we will finally be awakened as one to respond to other potential global emergencies with the urgency that they too deserve in a similar way as we are seeing across the world today."
